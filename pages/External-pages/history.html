          In the state of Madhya Pradesh lies the Vindha Range, and in the heart
          of the range lies the Panna National Park which is a living example of
          both carelessness and the dedication of humanity towards nature. The
          history is not as simple about dates and incidents but a pure drama
          about the hunts, the loss and how the comeback has become a legendary
          chapter in the global conservation. This was a private hunting ground
          at first, and how it came to be the home for a tiger reserve, the
          story will fascinate you.

              The landscape of the park tells the history of the Panna National
              Park. It was spread across the Malda zone, which was a calm and
              silent place known for hunting. The powerful Bundela rulers of the
              princely states of Panna, Chhatarpur, and Bijawar have made it a
              private hunting zone.

              <div class="bg-green-100 p-4 rounded-lg">
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                  In the initial years, the region called Bundelkhand which is a
                  rocky plateau made it difficult for the survival of humans and
                  animals. And for over centuries the Bundela dynasty ruled that
                  from the 16th century until India's independence in 1947 and
                  treated this piece of land as their own private sport as
                  hunting. The forest gained significant prominence when the
                  great warrior-king Maharaja Chhatrasal established his capital
                  in Panna and put this region firmly on the map of central
                  India.

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                  Again this sport continued till India got independent. After
                  that the care of the forest was taken under the government and
                  the first step towards the protection began in 1975 with the
                  creation of the Gangau Wildlife Sanctuary. This was formed by
                  combining the North and South Panna forest divisions which
                  marked the official start of wildlife conservation efforts in
                  the area.

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                  As the journey continued, in 1978, the Gangau Sanctuary was
                  expanded to include areas from the Chhatarpur forest division.
                  And in 1981 this expansion of the area was officially declared
                  as the Panna National Park integrating the original Gangau
                  Sanctuary. But in 1994, Panna was declared India's 22nd Tiger
                  Reserve and the 5th in central India and gained more
                  recognition. Also this included the Ken Gharial Wildlife
                  Sanctuary which created the larger and interconnected
                  protected zone for biodiversity.

                  Apart from this royal history, this has a part from the
                  mythological point of view. The famous Pandav Caves in the
                  park is mentioned in the epic Hindu Mahabharata. It is
                  believed that the Pandava princes spent a considerable part of
                  their long exile hiding and living in these very forests which
                  adds a layer of ancient cultural significance to the land.

              The Tiger Reserve in Panna was a great success which lasted for a

              species of deers. Spread across an area of 542 square kilometres

                  However there was a crisis which was already on the way. By
                  2002 it was home to 30 tigers and within the next 6 years it
                  decreased to 18 only. The reasons for this devastation is
                  multiple:
                </p>

                <ul class="flex flex-col gap-1 ml-5 list-disc">
                  <li>
                    Poaching was the primary culprit which was driven by the
                    high demand for bones, skins and other body parts in the
                    illegal wildlife trade. It was used for medicines or as a
                    status symbol that led to the targeting of the tigers of
                    Panna. Even the black market had a huge value for these.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The expansion of the human settlement led to the destruction
                    of natural habitat. Agriculture, infrastructure around the
                    park led to the fragmentation of the home of the tiger. This
                    made it more vulnerable to poachers by pushing the tigers
                    into smaller and more accessible areas to hunt them.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    As the habitats were destroyed it led to the Human-Wildlife

                  It reached its climax in 2009 to break your heart. After
                  extensive surveys, the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) made
                  a shocking official announcement: the entire tiger population
                  in the Panna Tiger Reserve had been wiped out. Not a single
                  tiger was found in this park. The news sent shockwaves through
                  the conservation community in India and around the world. So
                  it gave a warning of the conservation failure and the threats
                  facing endangered species everywhere.

              It was a very sad moment for the complete loss of all tigers but
              it also started one of the most successful animal-saving projects
              in India. Soon after this devastating news the Indian government
              with help from groups like the Wildlife Trust of India began the
              Panna Tiger Reintroduction Project to bring tigers back to the
              park.

                  This task was not easy as it seems to be. It was a careful,
                  science-based plan to save the forest and its animals. The
                  plan included:

                    Reintroduction of Tigers: This is the most critical and bold
                    step to bring new tigers to Panna, where two tigresses were
                    relocated from Bandhavgarh and Kanha Tiger Reserves, and a
                    male tiger was brought from Pench Tiger Reserve. Initially
                    there was a problem as the male tiger had no female partner
                    and left the park but later it was bought safely. In April
                    2010 the first tigress from Bandhavgarh had three cubs and
                    later the second tigress from Kanha also had babies. Later
                    in 2011, another tigress was brought to keep the tiger
                    family healthy and strong.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Strengthening Anti-Poaching Measures: To keep the tigers
                    safe, a larger number of forest guards were added which
                    added a quick-response to the team. Advanced and new tools
                    like drones and camera traps were also used to watch over
                    the tiger families all the time.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Village Relocation and Community Involvement: Some villages
                    moved out of the center of the park to give more space for
                    animals and avoid problems. The people were given money, new
                    land, and other jobs. Many were trained to work as forest
                    guards and guides. This made them feel part of the park and
                    helped them protect it.

                  <li>
                    Habitat Restoration: The park’s nature was made healthy
                    again as local trees and grasses were planted, and small
                    dams and waterholes were built so deer and other animals had
                    enough food and water for the tigers.

              The hard work gave wonderful results that led from having no
              tigers in 2009 and Panna slowly grew its tiger family. By 2020,
              there were about 52 tigers, and the number is still growing. The
              park became strong and full of life again. The project helped not
              just tigers but the whole forest. Planting trees and saving water
              made nature better for all animals. Tourism also grew, giving
              people jobs and improving the area. It showed that saving wildlife
              can also help local communities. The history of Panna National
              Park is a powerful lesson that teaches us how dangerous neglect
              and hunting can be. But it also gives hope. With good planning,
              teamwork, and help from local people, Panna showed that even lost
              tigers can return. Today, Panna is like a phoenix, showing the
              world that with care and effort, we can fix our mistakes and save
              wildlife for the future.
